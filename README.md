# Welcome
Squirrel is a python othello(aka reversi) ai. A simple ai plays humanlike. It is not that strong but it is enough to beat beginners. Have fun with Squirrel.

# About the ai
Squirrel used alpha-beta pruning and opening books. Pypy is the best choice for Squirrel, it will think faster than normal (about 5 times faster). It needs around 5 mins to finish the whole game (if it doesn't use pypy, it needs around 25 mins to finish the whole game). Sorry for no GUI board.

# How to use

- Unzip it
